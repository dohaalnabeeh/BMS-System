<br />

## **The Problem** :no_entry_sign: :-

- Building owners and managers face hardships to manage users' services, their payment schedules, and their history manually. That would cause huge problems like wasting some time and effort. Managers encounter these problems to track the users' histories, and all of these operations are done with paperwork that is not durable.

- They find it hard to advertise available apartments, they would put a paper on the building to announce the available apartment or advertise it on Facebook

## **The solution** :bulb: :-

- Building owners and managers should harness technology to help them better manage their properties, also employing its advantages in durability by creating a web application to provide the specific requirements including a services list and database history for every user.

- A building management system helps property owners do just that. The software solution we‚Äôll introduce you to today not only streamlines previously tedious administrative tasks, but the software also better engages residents and helps create a stronger sense of community.
